# Hazld [WIP]

## Don't get Frazzled, use Hazld!

> Based off of [Lox](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/) with some [code-peeks here](https://github.com/SawyerHood/lox-typescript). Everyone should try and make their own little lang! 

Hazld is a interpreted _toy_ language built with AssemblyScript designed to be run on Dfinity canisters and in the browser. At some point this might become a serious tool for production deployments, but right now as it stands, this will blow up at-least 1000 different ways!
